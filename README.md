Hi! My name is John Grant. I'm a software test engineer currently working for Omron Robotics and Safety Technologies.

I am comfortable with the following programming languages, of which you can find samples in this (or other of my) repositories:
 - C
 - C++
 - C#
 - Python

This website is used as a project portfolio, and hopefully demo in the future. 

Thanks for looking!
